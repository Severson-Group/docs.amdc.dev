# Xilinx Tools

The AMDC firmware is built on top of the Xilinx toolchain.
The Xilinx tools are manditory for all users; without them, the AMDC does not function.

Basic actions which are common to all users are explained in these subpages.
Be sure to bookmark these pages; you may be coming back to them regularly during development!
