# Timing Manager

This page serves to document the operation and configuration of the AMDC Timing Manager, a system-level IP resposible for aligning sensor sampling, feedback, and control task execution to the PWM-carrier peak/valley for predicatable control.

The primary audience of this documentation is the AMDC development/maintainers team, but can also be a good reference for users of the platforms seeking to better understand the timing system of the AMDC to better optimize their control.
