# Control with AMDC

The AMDC Platform provides a versatile and open foundation for establishing high performance motor controls. This section of the documentation explains how to use the AMDC's capabilties to implement standard motor control functionality.

| Control Topic | Aim / Goal / Outcome |
|---|---|
| [Current Sensor Calibration](current-sensor-cal/index.md) | Approach and tools to calibrate current sensor gain and offset. |
| [Inverter Control Time Synchronization](control-timing/index.md) | Implementation of the standard inverter control sensor/PWM synchronization. |
